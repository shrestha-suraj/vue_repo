Form handeling in vue is simple

1) v-model [v-modal.lazy.trim.number]
-> This directive is used for two way data binding the native input element with a data value in js
-> You can directly insert v-modal in any input tag and it will do things for you:
    provide :value="js-variable"  and @input="js-variable=$event.target.value"

-> In order to create a CUSTOM INPUT element and take the advantage of v-modal we have to create a new component
    Example:   new component is called appSwitch

    In parent file where we import the component:  <app-switch v-modal='test'></app-switch> where test is a variabe in js
    Since we know that v-modal offers two atrributes to the tag we can go to the component and create props called ['value']
    This is provided by the v-modal. Then we can make changes based on our value and when we change anything we can trigger an
    event "input"  that will set the new value. There you go, you have your custom input element that can use v-modal

-> Types of input and how to handle them:
1) Regular Text/Email/Password Input:  <input v-modal="variable"/>

2) Number Input: <input v-modal.number="variable"/>  -> forcefully converts the input from string to number

3) CheckBox: <input v-modal="test" value="v1"/> <input v-modal="test" value="v2"/>  where test is an array in js
    Note: Vue.js automatically knows it is a checkbox beacuse of same modal being used and that the variable is an array

4) RadioButton:<input v-modal="test" value="v1"/> <input v-modal="test" value="v2"/>  where test is a variable in js
    Note: Vue.js automatically knows it is a radiobutton beacuse of same modal being used and that the variable is an element

5) Select: <select v-modal="variable">  (<option></option>) x N </select>  where variable is a variable in js
    Note: Vue.js automatically knows it is a select. I don't have any idea how it does it. It is just awesome


-> v-modal.lazy (Makes v-modal bind the data when focus is changed but not with every key stroke)
-> v-modal.trim (Trims the spaces on the data entered on the input)
-> v-modal.number (Even when text input is type number, it stores the date in string, this method converts it into number)


Important note on @click event
-> When the button for the form is clicked the form is automatically submitteed
-> To prevent this we can use @click.prevent="" to let vue handle the form submission
-> Also we are in a custom component say <app-switch></app-switch> that needs to listen for click events
   We can achieve this by using @click.native to let vue know that we are refering click to the parent element that is defined
   on the AppSwitch.vue component i.e. the html tag that is below <template> tag
