Introduction:
    This project demonstrates the memory saving functionality of Vue.js
Things Learned:
    - if we put functions in computed object of Vue instead of methods and we want the data preservation
      rather than re-rendering when any data value is changed, we use (computed) object. This is similar 
      to memoziation in React
