Introduction:
    This project demonstrates the memory saving functionality of Vue.js
Things Learned:
    - if we put functions in computed object of Vue instead of methods and we want the data preservation
      rather than re-rendering when any data value is changed, we use (computed) object. This is similar 
      to memoziation in React 
    
    - other technique is to use watch object whose key is the same key on the data object and whose value
      is the value is a function that is triggered when the value of key changes in the data making isolated 
      re-renders on the page
